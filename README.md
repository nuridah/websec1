The core structure of the site is html form, which is accompanied with css and javascript. Javascript is used to regulate the behaviour of certain components in an HTML form in order to restrict certain attributes from being utilised in specific attributes. For example, if the question asks the user to submit their email address only using their gmail account, then to prevent the user from entering any other email addresses by using the html pattern pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+@gmail.com$."
